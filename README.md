Advanced JavaScript | Lecture 5 Task 3

Using event delegation, write an event listener that removes a paragraph from the “TODO list” when the corresponding delete button is clicked. 

When done, you should be able to add items to the TODO list, and then remove them by clicking
the X. Clicking elsewhere on the TODO item or elsewhere in the list container will do nothing.
